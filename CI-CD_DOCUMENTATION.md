## *. Run workflow manually

Once you've set up all the steps above correctly, you should be able to successfully complete a manual execution of the "!_PROJECT_NAME_! CI/CD Pipeline" workflow.

  1. Go to the project's GitHub repository and click on the **Actions** tab

  2. From the "Workflows" list on the left, click on "!_PROJECT_NAME_! CI/CD Pipeline"

  3. On the right, next to the "This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger" label, click on the "Run workflow" dropdown, make sure the default branch is selected (if not manually changed, should be main or master) in the "Use workflow from" dropdown and click the "Run workflow" button
