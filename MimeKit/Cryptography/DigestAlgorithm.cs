	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>Digest algorithms are secure hashing algorithms that are used
	/// to generate unique fixed-length signatures for arbitrary data.</para>
	/// <para>The most commonly used digest algorithms are currently MD5
	/// and SHA-1, however, MD5 was successfully broken in 2008 and should
	/// be avoided. In late 2013, Microsoft announced that they would be
	/// retiring their use of SHA-1 in their products by 2016 with the
	/// assumption that its days as an unbroken digest algorithm were
	/// numbered. It is speculated that the SHA-1 digest algorithm will
	/// be vulnerable to collisions, and thus no longer considered secure,
	/// by 2018.</para>
	/// <para>Microsoft and other vendors plan to move to the SHA-2 suite of
	/// digest algorithms which includes the following 4 variants: SHA-224,
	/// SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.</para>
