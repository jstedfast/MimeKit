	/// A DKIM canonicalization algorithm.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>Empirical evidence demonstrates that some mail servers and relay systems
	/// modify email in transit, potentially invalidating a signature. There are two
	/// competing perspectives on such modifications. For most signers, mild modification
	/// of email is immaterial to the authentication status of the email. For such signers,
	/// a canonicalization algorithm that survives modest in-transit modification is
	/// preferred.</para>
	/// <para>Other signers demand that any modification of the email, however minor,
	/// result in a signature verification failure. These signers prefer a canonicalization
	/// algorithm that does not tolerate in-transit modification of the signed email.</para>
	/// </remarks>
