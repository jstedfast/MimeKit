	/// <para>RC-2/40 was required by all S/MIME v2 implementations. However, since the
	/// mid-to-late 1990's, RC-2/40 has been considered to be extremely weak and starting with
	/// S/MIME v3.0 (published in 1999), all S/MIME implementations are required to implement
	/// support for Triple-DES (aka 3DES) and should no longer encrypt using RC-2/40 unless
	/// explicitly requested to do so by the user.</para>
	/// <para>These days, most S/MIME implementations support the AES-128 and AES-256
	/// algorithms which are the recommended algorithms specified in S/MIME v3.2 and
	/// should be preferred over the use of Triple-DES unless the client capabilities
	/// of one or more of the recipients is unknown (or only supports Triple-DES).</para>
