	/// <remarks>
	/// There are two commonly used line-endings used by modern Operating Systems.
	/// Unix-based systems such as Linux and macOS use a single character (<c>'\n'</c> aka LF)
	/// to represent the end of line where-as Windows (or DOS) uses a sequence of two
	/// characters (<c>"\r\n"</c> aka CRLF). Most text-based network protocols such as SMTP,
	/// POP3, and IMAP use the CRLF sequence as well.
