	/// <summary>
	/// An interface for a multipart MIME entity which may contain a collection of MIME entities.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>All multipart MIME entities will have a Content-Type with a media type of <c>"multipart"</c>.
	/// The most common multipart MIME entity used in email is the <c>"multipart/mixed"</c> entity.</para>
	/// <para>Four (4) initial subtypes were defined in the original MIME specifications: mixed, alternative,
	/// digest, and parallel.</para>
	/// <para>The "multipart/mixed" type is a sort of general-purpose container. When used in email, the
	/// first entity is typically the "body" of the message while additional entities are most often
	/// file attachments.</para>
	/// <para>Speaking of message "bodies", the "multipart/alternative" type is used to offer a list of
	/// alternative formats for the main body of the message (usually they will be "text/plain" and
	/// "text/html"). These alternatives are in order of increasing faithfulness to the original document
	/// (in other words, the last entity will be in a format that, when rendered, will most closely match
	/// what the sending client's WYSISYG editor produced).</para>
	/// <para>The "multipart/digest" type will typically contain a digest of MIME messages and is most
	/// commonly used by mailing-list software.</para>
	/// <para>The "multipart/parallel" type contains entities that are all meant to be shown (or heard)
	/// in parallel.</para>
	/// <para>Another commonly used type is the "multipart/related" type which contains, as one might expect,
	/// inter-related MIME parts which typically reference each other via URIs based on the Content-Id and/or
	/// Content-Location headers.</para>
	/// </remarks>
