# Release Notes

## MimeKit 4.13.0 (2025-06-25)

* Fixed a memory leak in MimeAnonymizer and MimeUtils.Unquote() which gets used by the
  address parser. (issue [#1161](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/discussions/1161))
* Optimized MimeReader and MimeParser to use Span&lt;T&gt;.IndexOf() on .NET Core which
  can improve performance by 20-30% when parsing MemoryStreams or 5-10% when parsing
  FileStreams.
* Optimized the MboxFromFilter and ArmoredFromFilter by using Span&lt;T&gt;.IndexOf().
* Fixed S/MIME logic to allow certificates without the KeyEncipherment key usage for
  encryption. (issue [#1165](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/discussions/1165))
* Added MimeAnonymizer.PreserveHeaders as a way of preventing anonymization for
  specific headers.
* Added message/deliver-status and message/disposition-notification support to
  MimeAnonymizer.
* Slightly optimized the Unix2DosFilter.

## MimeKit 4.12.0 (2025-04-28)

* Removed CTRL characters from the list of allowed domain characters.
* Fixed a bug in the address list parser in Strict mode that allowed 2 addresses to be
  separated by whitespace instead of requiring a comma.
* Added a new MimeAnonymizer class that can be used to anonymize MimeMessages by
  x-ing out non-syntactically relevant information.
* Fixed TryParse methods to not throw ArgumentExceptions.
  (issue [#1158](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/discussions/1158))
* Fixed a bug in MimeReader that used the buffer offset instead of the stream offset
  to check if the stream position was beyond the byte offset specified by a
  Content-Length header when parsing UNIX mbox files.
* Fixed a long-standing bug in MimeParser (which also existed in MimeReader) where
  it would encounter a buffering bug when parsing some Mbox files (typically
  multi-gigabyte). (issue [#991](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/discussions/991))
* Fixed AttachmentCollection.Add/AddAsync methods to dispose the MimePart it is creating
  if loading content fails from the stream fails.
* Added leaveOpen parameters for HtmlWriter .ctors.
  (issue [#1159](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/discussions/1159))
* Fixed parsing when ParserOptions.AllowUnquotedCommasInAddresses = false. This used to
  incorrectly allow unquoted commas in address Display Names if the comma followed at least
  2 words.

## MimeKit 4.11.0 (2025-03-08)

* Fixed logic for validating HTML Tag and Attribute names.
  (issue [#1136](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/discussions/1136))
* Minor performance improvements to MimeParser, ExperimentalMimeParser, and MimeReader.
* Obsoleted MimeReader.OnMultipartBoundary() and OnMultipartEndBoundary(), replacing them
  with OnMultipartBoundaryBegin/Read/End() and OnMultipartEndBoundaryBegin/Read/End().
  This now allows ExperimentalMimeParser to track trailing whitespace on boundary lines,
  resulting in improved re-serialization of parsed messages.
* Fixed serialization of message/rfc822 parts without a message.
* Fixed serialization of messages that did not have a blank line between the headers and body
  (only when parsed using the ExperimentalMimeParser).
* When using DbTransactions, set the transaction on the DbCommands.
  (issue [#1142](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/1142))
* Improved Date header parser for JST and KST timezones.
* Improved Date header parser to handle AM/PM and leap seconds.
* Improved address parser to handle unbalanced ')' (rfc7103)

## MimeKit 4.10.0 (2025-01-26)

* Fixed logic for converting BouncyCastle DSA keys to System.Security equivalents.
* Fixed BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext to respect the CheckCertificateRevocation property when
  encrypting to recipeints and when verifying signatures.
* Marked IX509CertificateDatabase.Update(X509CrlRecord) as obsolete.
* Fixed TemporarySecureMimeContext.Import(X509Crl) to not import duplicates.
* Added new MimeMessage .ctor that takes IEnumerable&lt;Header&gt;.
* Fixed MimeReader to better handle garbage at the start of an mbox.
* Fixed MimeReader/ExperimentalMimeParser to handle really long mbox markers by introducing
  2 new methods: OnMboxMarkerBegin() and OnMboxMarkerEnd().
* Improved MimeReader header parsing (mostly just state tracking improvements) which
  allows it to throw the appropriate exception if EOS is reached before parsing any
  headers.
* Make sure to flush any remaining text in the FlowedToText and FlowedToHtml converters
  (issue [#1130](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/1130))
* Fixed Header folding/encoding logic for Original-Message-ID by making it follow the same
  rules as Message-ID/Content-ID/etc.
  (issue [#1133](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/1133))

## MimeKit 4.9.0 (2024-12-09)

  issues related to SQLite database loading for the S/MIME certificate database).
  (MailKit issue [#10844](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/1844))
* Fixed TextPreviewer to use an encoding with an empty string fallback to prevent '?' characters from
  being appended to the generated preview string if the byte sequence was truncated.

* Added work-around for broken Message-ID header values of the form &lt;id@@domain&gt;.
  (issue [#962](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/962))
* Added virtual Multipart.TryGetValue(TextFormat, out TextPart) method that recursively
  iterates over child parts to find the TextPart with the desired format.
* Fixed MimeMessage.TextBody/HtmlBody to locate the text body in a multipart/mixed that is
  inside of a multipart/alternative. This resolves an issue locating the text body within
  some broken iOS Apple Mail messages. (issue [#963](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/963))

## MimeKit 4.2.0 (2023-09-02)

  This is a very small reduction in GC pressure.
* Reduced memory allocations in Rfc2047.DecodePhrase() and DecodeText().
* Avoid allocating empty `List<string>`s in DomainList.ctor(), lazily allocate the
  list only when a domain is added. Another minor reduction in GC pressure.
* Updated the Date parser to allocate an internal list of tokens with a optimal
  initial capacity to avoid the need for reallocating.

## MimeKit 4.1.0 (2023-06-17)

* Readded the System.Net.Mail-to-MimeKit conversion APIs for the netstandard2.x frameworks.
  (issue [#913](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/913))

  to dispose of the stream until after the entity has been parsed.
  (issue [#916](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/916))
* Optimized conversion between HeaderId and string.
* Added a new IMimeParser interface that both MimeParser and ExperimentalMimePraser implement.
* Added "unicode" to the list of charset aliases for UTF-8.
  (issue [#923](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/923))
* Added support for the Edwards Curve DSA PGP public key algorithm.

* Fixed System.Net.Mail.MailMessage -> MimeMessage converter to reset MailMessage attachment/alternateview streams back
  to 0 after copying them. (issue [#907](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/907))
* Added support for the signature expiration field in DKIM signatures which can be specified
  using the new DkimSigner.SignatureExpiresAfter property.
* Added equality operators for TnefNameId and TnefPropertyTag.
* Fixed MimeMessage's MessageId, ResentMessageId and InReplyTo property setters to be more lax.
  (issue [#912](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/912))
* MimeKit and MimeKitLite nuget packages now include MimeKit.dll.config that contain assembly redirects
  which *may* resolve some issues some developers were having with loading assemblies such as
  System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll.

## MimeKit 3.6.1 (2023-03-19)

* Improved logic for reformatting headers when MimeMessage.WriteTo() is called with FormatOptions.International
  set to true.
* Fixed logic for quoting and/or encoding the MailboxAddress.Name in cases where the Name string contains
  quotes or parenthesis (especially when unicode characters are within the quotes or parenthesis).
* Improved logic in the address parser when it comes to unquoting mailbox names (i.o.w. unquote *before* decoding
  rather than after).
* Modified the Message-ID/Content-ID parser to be more lenient.
  (issue [#835](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/835))

## MimeKit 3.4.0 (2022-08-17)

* Introduced a new IPunycode interface and Punycode class allowing developers to override the default
  implementation that uses .NET's IdnMapping class.
  (issue [#801](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/801))
* Added HtmlAttributeCollection Contains, IndexOf and TryGetValue methods.
* Dropped .NET5.0 support.

  (issue [#790](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/790))
* Fixed the MemoryBlockStream.Read() method to handle cases where the length of the stream is longer than
  int.MaxValue.
* Fixed TnefPart.ConvertToMessage() to promote lone multipart/mixed subparts to become the message body
  much like it used to work pre-v3.2.0. (issue [#789](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/789))
* Reduced memory usage when using SecureMimeContext.Compress() and CompressAsync().
* Dropped support for net452 and net461 now that their life cycles have ended and are no longer supported
  by Microsoft. (issue [#768](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/768))
* Added support for net462.

Special thanks to Fedir Klymenko for his improvements to MemoryBlockStream and SecureMimeContext.Compress!

## MimeKit 3.2.0 (2022-03-26)

* Rewrote QuotedPrintableEncoder to more strictly fold at the specified line length.
  (issue [#781](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/781))
* Change the default maxLineLength for quoted-printable/base64 encoders to 76 to match the recommendation
  in the specification (was previously 72).
* Use cached Task instances (e.g. Task.CompletedTask) when possible to improve performance.
* Make use of ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt; instead of String.Substring() wherever possible to improve performance.
* Reduced string allocations in other ways.
* Provide MailboxAddress accessors for LocalPart and Domain.
  (issue [#766](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/766))
* Replaced support for .NET Framework v4.6 with 4.6.1 and added a System.Text.Encoding.CodePages dependency

  when system character encodings were not available.
* Fixed MessagePartial to use invariant culture when setting number/total param values.
* Make sure all int.TryParse() calls use the correct NumberStyles.
* Make use of a ValueStringBuilder to construct strings without needing to allocate a StringBuilder.

  (issue [#762](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/762))
* Added dispose handling to MimeMessage.CreateFromMailMessage().
* Improved MIME structure returned by TnefPart.ConvertToMessage().
* Rewrote header folding logic to avoid string allocations.
* Implemented IEquatable&lt;T&gt; on TnefNameId.
* If iso-8859-1 isn't available, fall back to ASCII instead of Windows-1252.
  (issue [#751](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/751))

Special Thanks to Jason Nelson for taking the lead on many of the listed (and unlisted) performance
improvements and helping me make MimeKit even more awesome!

## MimeKit 3.1.1 (2022-01-30)

* When initializing character encodings for netstandard and net50/net60, wrap the Reflection logic
  to invoke System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider() in a try/catch to prevents exceptions when
  using the netstandard version of MimeKit in a .NET Framework app.
  (issue [#751](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/751))
* Added a work-around for Office365 `message/delivery-status` parts where all status groups after
  the first are base64 encoded. This seems to be a bug in Office365 where it treats the first
  status group as MIME entity and the following status groups as the content.
  (issue [#250](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/250))
* Fixed the MimeMessage .ctor that takes object parameters to first check that a Message-Id
  header was not supplied before generating one for the message.
  (issue [#747](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/747))
* Fixed the BestEncodingFilter logic such that if any line in binary content is > 998 and it contains
  nul bytes, it should recommend base64 (not quoted-printable).

## MimeKit 3.1.0 (2022-01-14)

* Always use a lowercase domain name in the Message-Id to work around bugs in eM Client.
  (issue [#734](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/734))
* Improved handling of parsing Content-Types like "multipart/multipart/mixed; boundary=...".
  (issue [#737](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/737))
* Added a maxLineLength argument to the QuotedPrintableEncoder .ctor.
* Added maxLineLength arguments to EncoderFilter.Create() methods.
* Fixed MimePart.Prepare() to remember the maxLineLength argument value for later use in the
  WriteTo() implementation. This maxLineLength value can then be passed to the Base64 or
  QuotedPrintable encoder so that it can properly limit lines to that length (up to a max of
  76 characters as per the specs). (issue [#743](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/743))
* Added net6.0 to the list of TargetFrameworks.

## MimeKit 3.0.0 (2021-12-11)

* Removed APIs marked as \[Obsolete\] in 2.x.
* Refactored X509CertificateDatabase protected methods to include a DbConnection parameter.
* Removed OpenPgpContextBase by folding the logic into OpenPgpContext.
* Added Async APIs for OpenPGP and S/MIME.
* Lazy-load headers on MimeMessage and MimeEntity (and subclasses) to improve performance.
* Added a new MimeReader class that acts as a lower-level MimeParser alternative, allowing developers
  to parse MIME content without having to instantiate a MIME tree of objects or wait until the parser
  has completed (and returned a MimeMessage or MimeEntity object) before processing MIME data. This is
  conceptually similar to a SAX XML parser approach.
* Added a new ExperimentalMimeParser that duplicates MimeParser functionality, but is built on top of
  MimeReader. This implementation will eventually replace MimeParser once I get some feedback on it.
  Should be ~5% faster than MimeParser.
* Improved MimeParser performance slightly based on some of the experimentation done to make the
  ExperimentalMimeParser fast.
* Added CancellationToken arguments for some AttachmentCollection.Add() overloads.
* Use 'net5.0' as the .NET 5.0 target framework moniker instead of 'net50'.
  (issue [#720](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/720))
* Drop support for .NET 4.5 and replace it with .NET 4.5.2
* Bumped Portable.BouncyCastle to 1.9.0
* Added new MimeMessage.GetRecipients() method.
* Make it possible to bypass MimeEntity preparation for signing by adding a PrepareBeforeSigning property to
  CryptographyContext. (issue [#721](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/721))
* MimeMessage and MimeEntity now implement IDisposable.
  (issue [#732](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/732))

## MimeKit 2.15.1 (2021-09-13)

* Improved MimeParser to be a little more efficient based on work being done for the upcoming v3.0 release.
* Fixed a bug in the MimeParser exposed by added unit tests regarding Content-Length handling.
* Improved address parser error messages.
* Fixed MailboxAddress.Address to be forgiving if there is trailing whitespace after the addr-spec token when
  setting MailboxAddress.Address. (issue [#705](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/705))
* Fixed MimeMessage and MimeEntity.ToString() to not write a newline before the message/entity
  (regression introduced in 2.14.0).

## MimeKit 2.15.0 (2021-08-18)

* Use DebugType=full for .NET Framework v4.x. (MailKit issue [#1239](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/1239))
* Fixed bug in MultipartSigned.VerifyAsync() that would dispose of the crypto context before the async task was
  complete, resulting in an OperationCanceledException.
* Default to using the Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile directory instead of Personal when GNUPGHOME isn't defined
  in the environment. The Personal directory maps to the MyDocuments directory, so this wasn't correct. The .gnupg
  directory should be in the user's HOME directory.
* Added ContentType.ToString(bool encode) and ContentDisposition.ToString(bool encode) convenience methods.
* Changed the public Header.Parse/TryParse APIs to canonicalize header values to end with a newline even if the input
  string does not. (issue [#695](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/695))

## MimeKit 2.14.0 (2021-07-28)

* Allow ..'s and trailing .'s in the local-part of an addr-spec by introducing a new RfcComplianceMode.Looser
  enum value that can be set on the ParserOptions.AddressParserComplianceMode property.
  (issue [#682](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/682))
* Use Reflection to call Encoding.RegisterProvider() so that referencing the netstandard MimeKit assemblies
  from .NET 4.8 won't crash. (issue [#683](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/683))
* Don't write the X-MimeKit warning header in ToString() anymore. This is a lost cause.
* Updated the OpenPgpContext to default to keys.openpgp.org since keys.gnupg.net does not resolve via DNS anymore.

## MimeKit 2.13.0 (2021-06-11)

* Added a way to force MimeKit to always quote parameter values.

  (issue [#499](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/499))
* Modified Multipart.WriteTo[Async] to not ensure that a Content-Type boundary parameter
  has been set. This code-path was only hit if the multipart was parsed by the parser and
  did not have a boundary parameter in the first place. In the interest of preserving

## MimeKit 1.0.11 (2015-03-21)

* Added the ContentDisposition.FormData string constant.
* Allow the ContentDisposition.Disposition property to be set to values other than
  "attachment" and "inline". (issue [#112](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/112))
* Shortened the length of the local-part of auto-generated Message-Ids.
* Fixed MimeMessage.CreateFromMailMessage() to not duplicate From/To/Cc/etc addresses
  if the System.Net.Mail.MailMessage has been sent via System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient
  prior to calling MimeMessage.CreateFromMailMessage(). (issue [#115](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/115))
* When parsing S/MIME digital signatures, don't import the full certificate chain.
  (issue [#110](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/110))
* Added immutability-friendly .ctor to MimeMessage for use with languages such as F#.
  (issue [#116](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/116))

## MimeKit 1.0.10 (2015-03-14)

* Ignore semi-colons in Content-Transfer-Encoding headers to work around broken mailers.
* Added ParserOptions.ParameterComplianceMode (defaults to RfcComoplianceMode.Loose)
  which works around unquoted parameter values in Content-Type and Content-Disposition
  headers. (issue [#106](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/106))
* Modified the MimeParser to handle whitespace between header field names and the ':'.
* Probe to make sure that various System.Text.Encodings are available before adding
  aliases for them (some may not be available depending on the platform).
* Added a MimePart.GetBestEncoding() overload that takes a maxLineLength argument.
* Modified MultipartSigned to use 78 characters as the max line length rather than 998
  characters. (issue [#107](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/107))

## MimeKit 1.0.9 (2015-03-08)

* Added a new MessageDispositionNotification MimePart subclass to represent
  message/disposition-notification parts.
* Fixed the TNEF parser to gracefully deal with duplicate attachment properties.

## MimeKit 1.0.8 (2015-03-02)

* Modified the parser to accept Message-Id values without a domain (i.e. "<local-part@>").
* Fixed a NullReferenceException in MimeMessage.BodyParts in cases where a MessagePart
  has a null Message.
* Renamed DateUtils.TryParseDateTime() to DateUtils.TryParse() (the old API still exists
  but has been marked [Obsolete]).
* Renamed MimeUtils.TryParseVersion() to MimeUtils.TryParse() (the old API still exists
  but has been marked [Obsolete]).
* Fixed S/MIME support to gracefully deal with badly formatted signature timestamps
  which incrorectly use leap seconds. (issue [#103](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/103))

## MimeKit 1.0.7 (2015-02-17)

* Fixed TnefPropertyReader.GetEmbeddedMessageReader() to skip the Guid.
* When decrypting PGP data, iterate over all encrypted packets to find one that
  can be decrypted (i.e. the private key exists in the user's keychain).
* Updated WindowsSecureMimeContext to respect SecureMailboxAddresses like the
  other backends. (issue [#100](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/100))
* Added a Pkcs9SigningTime attribute to the CmsSigner for WindowsSecureMimeContext.
  (issue [#101](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/101))

## MimeKit 1.0.6 (2015-01-18)

* Vastly improved MS-TNEF support. In addition to being fixed to properly extract
  the AttachData property of an Attachment attribute, more metadata is captured
  and translated to the MIME equivalents (such as attachment creation and
  modification times, the size of the attachment, and the display name).
* Migrated the iOS assemblies to Xamarin.iOS Unified API for 64-bit support.

Note: If you are not yet ready to port your iOS application to the Unified API,
      you will need to stick with the 1.0.5 release. The Classic MonoTouch API
      is no longer supported.

## MimeKit 1.0.5 (2015-01-10)

* Fixed out-of-memory error when encoding some long non-ASCII parameter values in
  Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers.

## MimeKit 1.0.4 (2015-01-08)

* Added workaround for msg-id tokens with multiple domains
  (e.g. id@domain1@domain2).
* Added convenience methods to Header to allow the use of charset strings.
* Added more HeaderList.Replace() method overloads for convenience.
* Added a FormatOptions property to disallow the use of mixed charsets when
  encoding headers (issue [#139](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/139)).

## MimeKit 1.0.3 (2014-12-13)

* Improved MimeMessage.TextBody and MimeMessage.HtmlBody logic. (issue [#87](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/87))
* Added new overrides of TextPart.GetText() and SetText() methods that take a
  charset string argument instead of a System.Text.Encoding.
* Fixed charset fallback logic to work properly (it incorrectly assumed that
  by default, Encoding.UTF8.GetString() would throw an exception when it
  encountered illegal byte sequences). (issue [#88](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/88))
* Fixed S/MIME logic for finding X.509 certificates to use for encipherment.
  (issue [#89](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/89))

## MimeKit 1.0.2 (2014-12-05)

* Fixed MimeMessage.HtmlBody and MimeMessage.TextBody to properly
  handle nested multipart/alternatives (only generated by automated
  mailers).

## MimeKit 1.0.1 (2014-11-23)

* Added MimeMessage.HtmlBody and MimeMessage.TextBody convenience properties.
* Added TextPart.IsPlain and TextPart.IsHtml convenience properties.
