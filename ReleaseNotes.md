# Release Notes

### MimeKit 2.5.2 (2020-03-14)

* Updated net46, net47, and net48 builds to reference Portable.BouncyCastle instead of
  the standard BouncyCastle package, just like the netstandard builds.
  (issue [#540](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/540))
* Fixed extraction of TNEF EmbeddedMessage attachment data to skip the leading GUID.
  (issue [#538](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/538))
* Added a few more TNEF property tags.
* Fixed the HtmlEntityDecoder to require some named attributes to end with a `;`.

* Fixed parsing of email addresses containing unicode or other types of 8-bit text.
  (issue [#536](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/536))
* Added a MimeTypes.TryGetExtension() method to try and get a file name extension
  based on a mime-type.

* Fixed reserialization of message/rfc822 parts to not add an extra new-line sequence
  to the end of the message. (issue [#510](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/510))

  (issue [#508](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/508))
* Modified the Message-Id parser to gobble ctrl chars in the local-part.
* Fixed some buglets in the TextToFlowed converter involving space-stuffing lines.
* Fixed BodyBuilder logic for constructing a body with an HtmlBody set to string.Empty.
  (issue [#506](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/506))
* Fixed potential memory leaks in WindowsSecureMimeContext and BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext
  in the Export() methods in cases where an exception is throw while adding certificates.
* Removed MimeKit.Cryptography.NpgsqlCertificateDatabase. It is unlikely anyone actually
  uses this.

### MimeKit 2.3.1 (2019-09-08)

* Updated CmsSigner's default DigestAlgorithm to Sha256 instead of Sha1 to match
  System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.CmsSigner's default.

  System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.CmsSigner.
* Added support for the RSASSA-PSS signature padding algorithm when using the
  BouncyCastle backend.

* Modified FilteredStream.Flush*() to not flush the source stream.
  (MailKit issue [#904](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/904))
* Added net46 and net47 assemblies to the NuGet package.

### MimeKit 2.3.0 (2019-08-24)

* Fixed MultipartRelated to fall back to the multipart/related type parameter when

* Improved Authentication-Results parser to handle non-standard syntax.
  (issue [#490](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/490))
* When FormatOptions.AllowMixedHeaderCharsets is disabled, always use the user-specified
  charset. Previously this could/would still use us-ascii and/or iso-8859-1 if the entire
  header could fit within one of those charsets.
  (issue [#493](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/493))
* Fixed the line length calculations in the BestEncodingFilter.
  (issue [#497](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/497))
* Fixed Multipart to properly ensure the epilogue ends w/ a new-line when
  FormatOptions.EnsureNewLine is true.
  (issue [#499](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/499))
* Modified Multipart.WriteTo[Async] to not ensure that a Content-Type boundary parameter
  has been set. This code-path was only hit if the multipart was parsed by the parser and
  did not have a boundary parameter in the first place. In the interest of preserving
  byte-for-byte compatibility with the original input, this sanity check has been removed.
  (issue [#499](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/499))

### MimeKit 2.2.0 (2019-06-11)

* Added support for [ARC](https://arc-spec.org).

  - MimeMessage.Sign (DkimSigner, ...) has been replaced by DkimSigner.Sign (MimeMessage, ...).
  - MimeMessage.Verify (Header, ...) has been replaced by DkimVerifier.Verify (MimeMessage, Header, ...).

* Override Equals(object) and GetHashCode() for InternetAddress and InternetAddressList.
  (issue [#481](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/481))

* Fixed the Message-Id, Content-Id, References and In-Reply-To parsers to be more liberal
  in what they accept in terms of the `msg-id` token.
* Changed the Header encoding logic for the In-Reply-To header to not rfc2047 encode the value
  even if it is longer than the suggested line-length.
  (issue [#479](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/479))

  extracted message bodies. (issue [#435](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/435))
* Fixed various locations that loaded content from files to use FileShare.Read so as to avoid file
  sharing violations if the application already has that file opened elsewhere. (issue [#426](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/426))

### MimeKit 2.0.4 (2018-05-21)

* The default value of the `CheckCertificateRevocation` property located on the
  `BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext` has been changed to `false` due to privacy concerns noted
  in the <a href="https://efail.de">Efail</a> document published in May of 2018. Clients that
  wish to continue automatic downloads of S/MIME CRLs can manually set the property to `true`.
* Properly wrap long mailbox names with quoted phrases.
* Fixed parsing of header blocks that span across read boundaries. (issue [#395](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/395))

### MimeKit 2.0.2 (2018-03-18)

* IDN encode/decode the local part of mailbox addresses as well. (MailKit issue [#649](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/issues/649))
* Added a record for .epub to the MimeTypes database. (issue [#376](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/376))
* Explicitly pass 'false' as the silent argument to SignedCms.ComputeSignature(). (issue [#374](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/374))
* Make sure the MimeParser does not hang if the last header line is truncated before CRLF.

  to AES-256, which is the same value used in older versions of MimeKit.

### MimeKit 2.0.0 (2017-12-22)

* Added IDkimPublicKeyLocator.LookupPublicKeyAsync() and MimeMessage.VerifyAsync() to support
  asynchronous DNS lookups of DKIM public keys.
* Fixed tokenization of unquoted HTML attributes containing entities.
* Vastly improved the WindowsSecureMimeContext to do everything using System.Security
  instead of a mix of System.Security and Bouncy Castle.

  BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext that contained all of the Bouncy Castle-specific logic.
* Added useful extension methods to facilitate conversion between System.Security and
  Bouncy Castle crypto types (such as X509Certificates and AsymmetricAlgorithms).
* Renamed the IContentObject interface to IMimeContent.
* Renamed the ContentObject class to MimeContent.
* Renamed the MimePart.ContentObject property to MimePart.Content.

* Set the TnefReader charset on extracted text/plain and text/html bodies. (issue [#357](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/357))
* Added safeguard to protect against malformed nested group addresses which could cause
  a stack overflow in the parser. ParserOptions now has a way of limiting the recursive
  depth of rfc822 group addresses using the MaxAddressGroupDepth property. (issue [#355](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/355))
* Fixed the S/MIME certificate database for .NETStandard by using GetFieldValue() instead
  of GetBytes() which is not supported on .NETStandard. (issue [#351](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/351))

* Fixed MimeMessage.TextBody to return null when the top-level MIME part is a TextPart
  marked as an attachment.
* Fixed the HtmlToHtml converter to suppress comments if the HtmlTagContext's SuppressInnerContent
  property is active (even if FilterComments is false).
* Documented OpenPgpContext.GenerateKeyPair() which was added in 1.18.0.
* Added OpenPgpContext.Delete() methods to delete public and secret keyrings.
* Added OpenPgpContext.SignKey().
* Remove "Version:" header from armored OpenPGP output. (issue [#319](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/319))

### MimeKit 1.18.0 (2017-08-07)

  when the MailboxAddress argument is a SecureMailboxAddress. (issue [#322](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/322))
* Fall back to using the Subject Alternative Rfc822 Name if the SubjectEmailAddress fails. (issue [#323](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/323))

### MimeKit 1.16.2 (2017-07-01)

* Fixed a bug in the MailMessage to MimeMessage conversion which corrupted the Subject string. (issue [#306](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/306))

  group addresses.
* Improved the address parser to unquoted ',' and '.' characters in the name component of
  mailbox and group addresses.
* Added support for CryptographyContext factories by adding new Register() methods that

  encountered illegal byte sequences). (issue [#88](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/88))
* Fixed S/MIME logic for finding X.509 certificates to use for encipherment.
  (issue [#89](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit/issues/89))
