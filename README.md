## History

As a developer and user of Electronic Mail clients, I had come to realize that the vast majority of email client
(and server) software had less-than-satisfactory MIME implementations. More often than not these email clients
created broken MIME messages and/or would incorrectly try to parse a MIME message thus subtracting from the full
benefits that MIME was meant to provide. MimeKit is meant to address this issue by following the MIME specification
as closely as possible while also providing programmers with an extremely easy to use high-level API.

This led me, at first, to implement another MIME parser library called [GMime](http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime)
which is implemented in C and later added a C# binding called GMime-Sharp.

Now that I typically find myself working in C# rather than lower level languages like C, I decided to
begin writing a new parser in C# which would not depend on GMime. This would also allow me to have more
flexibility in that I'd be able use Generics and create a more .NET-compliant API.

## Performance

While mainstream beliefs may suggest that C# can never be as fast as C, it turns out that with a bit of creative
parser design and a few clever optimizations 
<sup>[[1](http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/09/optimization-tips-tricks-used-by.html)]
[[2](http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/10/optimization-tips-tricks-used-by.html)]</sup>, MimeKit's performance
is actually [on par with GMime](http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2014/03/gmime-gets-speed-boost.html).

Since GMime is pretty well-known as a high-performance native MIME parser and MimeKit more-or-less matches GMime's
performance, it stands to reason that MimeKit is likely unsurpassed in performance in the .NET MIME parser space.

For a comparison, as I [blogged here](http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2013/10/optimization-tips-tricks-used-by.html)
(I have since optimized MimeKit by at least another 30%), MimeKit is more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET, 75x faster
than SharpMimeTools, and 65x faster than regex-based parsers. Even the commercial MIME parser offerings such as LimiLabs'
Mail.dll and NewtonIdeas' Mime4Net cannot even come close to matching MimeKit's performance (they are both orders of
magnitude slower than MimeKit).

## Installing via NuGet

The easiest way to install MimeKit is via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MimeKit/).

In Visual Studio's [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console),
simply enter the following command:

    Install-Package MimeKit

## Building

First, you'll need to clone MimeKit and Bouncy Castle from my GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit.git
    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/bc-csharp.git
    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/Portable.Text.Encoding.git

Currently, MimeKit depends on the visual-studio-2010 branch of bc-csharp for the Visual Studio 2010 project
files that I've added (to replace the Visual Studio 2003 project files). To switch to that branch,

    cd bc-csharp
    git checkout -b visual-studio-2010 origin/visual-studio-2010

In the top-level MimeKit source directory, there are several solution files:

* MimeKit.Mobile.sln just includes the Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android projects.
* MimeKit.Net40.sln just includes the .NET Framework 4.0 C# project (MimeKit/MimeKit.csproj) and the UnitTests
project (UnitTests/UnitTests.csproj).
* MimeKit.sln includes everything that is in the MimeKit.Net40.sln solution as well as the projects for Xamarin.Android,
Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Mac.

If you don't have the Xamarin products, you'll probably want to open the MimeKit.Net40.sln instead of MimeKit.sln.

Once you've opened the appropriate MimeKit solution file in either Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio 2010+ (either will work),
you can simply choose the Debug or Release build configuration and then build.

Note: The Release build will generate the xml API documentation, but the Debug build will not.

## Using MimeKit

### Parsing Messages

One of the more common operations that MimeKit is meant for is parsing email messages from arbitrary streams.
There are two ways of accomplishing this task.

The first way is to use one of the Load() methods on MimeKit.MimeMessage:

```csharp
// Load a MimeMessage from a stream
var message = MimeMessage.Load (stream);
```

The second way is to use the MimeParser class. For the most part, using the MimeParser directly is not necessary
unless you wish to parse a Unix mbox file stream. However, this is how you would do it:

```csharp
// Load a MimeMessage from a stream
var parser = new MimeParser (stream, MimeFormat.Entity);
var message = parser.ParseMessage ();
```

For Unix mbox file streams, you would use the parser like this:

```csharp
// Load every message from a Unix mbox
var parser = new MimeParser (stream, MimeFormat.Mbox);
while (!parser.IsEndOfStream) {
    var message = parser.ParseMessage ();

    // do something with the message
}
```

### Traversing a MimeMessage

Once you have parsed a MimeMessage, you'll most likely want to traverse the tree of MIME entities.

The MimeMessage.Body is the top-level MIME entity of the message. Generally, it will either be a
TextPart or a Multipart.

As an example, if you wanted to render the MimeMessage to some sort of UI control, you might
use code similar to this:

```csharp
void RenderMessage (MimeMessage message)
{
    RenderMimeEntity (message.Body);
}

void RenderMimeEntity (MimeEntity entity)
{
    if (entity is MessagePart) {
        // This entity is an attached message/rfc822 mime part.
        var messagePart = (MessagePart) entity;

        // If you'd like to render this inline instead of treating
        // it as an attachment, you would just continue to recurse:
        RenderMessage (messagePart.Message);
    } else if (entity is Multipart) {
        // This entity is a multipart container.
        var multipart = (Multipart) entity;

        foreach (var subpart in multipart)
            RenderMimeEntity (subpart);
    } else {
        // Everything that isn't either a MessagePart or a Multipart is a MimePart
        var part = (MimePart) entity;

        // Don't render anything that is explicitly marked as an attachment.
        if (part.IsAttachment)
            return;

        if (part is TextPart) {
            // This is a mime part with textual content.
            var text = (TextPart) part;
    
            if (text.ContentType.Matches ("text", "html"))
                RenderHtml (text.Text);
            else
                RenderText (text.Text);
        } else if (entity.ContentType.Matches ("image", "*")) {
            using (var content = part.ContentObject.Open ()) {
                // render the raw image content
                RenderImage (content);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Getting the Decoded Content of a MIME Part

At some point, you're going to want to extract the decoded content of a MimePart (such as an image) and
save it to disk or feed it to a UI control to display it.

Once you've found the MimePart object that you'd like to extract the content of, here's how you can
save the decoded content to a file:

```csharp
// This will get the name of the file as specified by the sending mail client.
// Note: this value *may* be null, so you'll want to handle that case in your code.
var fileName = part.FileName;

using (var stream = File.Create (fileName)) {
    part.ContentObject.DecodeTo (stream);
}
```

You can also get access to the original encoded content and its encoding by "opening" the ContentObject.
This might be useful if you want to pass the content off to a UI control that can do its own loading
from a stream.

```csharp
using (var stream = part.ContentObject.Open ()) {
    // At this point, you can now read from the stream as if it were the original,
    // raw content. Assuming you have an image UI control that could load from a
    // stream, you could do something like this:
    imageControl.Load (stream);
}
```

There are a number of useful filters that can be applied to a FilteredStream, so if you find this type of
interface appealing, I suggest taking a look at the available filters in the MimeKit.IO.Filters namespace
or even write your own! The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.

### Creating a Simple Message

Creating MIME messages using MimeKit is really trivial.

```csharp
var message = new MimeMessage ();
message.From.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Joey", "joey@friends.com"));
message.To.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Alice", "alice@wonderland.com"));
message.Subject = "How you doin?";

message.Body = new TextPart ("plain") {
    Text = @"Hey Alice,

What are you up to this weekend? Monica is throwing one of her parties on
Saturday and I was hoping you could make it.

Will you be my +1?

-- Joey
"
};
```

A TextPart is a leaf-node MIME part with a text media-type. The first argument to the TextPart constructor
specifies the media-subtype, in this case, "plain". Another media subtype you are probably familiar with
is the "html" subtype. Some other examples include "enriched" and "csv".

The Text property is the easiest way to both get and set the string content of the MIME part.

### Creating a Message with Attachments

Attachments are just like any other MimePart, the only difference is that they typically have
a Content-Disposition header with a value of "attachment" instead of "inline" or no
Content-Disposition header at all.

Typically, when a mail client adds attachments to a message, it will create a multipart/mixed
part and add the text body part and all of the file attachments to the multipart/mixed.

Here's how you can do that with MimeKit:

```csharp
var message = new MimeMessage ();
message.From.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Joey", "joey@friends.com"));
message.To.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Alice", "alice@wonderland.com"));
message.Subject = "How you doin?";

// create our message text, just like before (except don't set it as the message.Body)
var body = new TextPart ("plain") {
    Text = @"Hey Alice,

What are you up to this weekend? Monica is throwing one of her parties on
Saturday and I was hoping you could make it.

Will you be my +1?

-- Joey
"
};

// create an image attachment for the file located at path
var attachment = new MimePart ("image", "gif") {
    ContentObject = new ContentObject (File.OpenRead (path), ContentEncoding.Default),
    ContentDisposition = new ContentDisposition (ContentDisposition.Attachment),
    ContentTransferEncoding = ContentEncoding.Base64,
    FileName = Path.GetFileName (path)
};

// now create the multipart/mixed container to hold the message text and the
// image attachment
var multipart = new Multipart ("mixed");
multipart.Add (body);
multipart.Add (attachment);

// now set the multipart/mixed as the message body
message.Body = multipart;
```

Of course, that is just a simple example. A lot of modern mail clients such as Outlook or Thunderbird will 
send out both a text/html and a text/plain version of the message text. To do this, you'd create a TextPart
for the text/plain part and a TextPart for the text/html part and then add them to a multipart/alternative
like so:

```csharp
var attachment = CreateAttachment ();
var plain = CreateTextPlainPart ();
var html = CreateTextHtmlPart ();

// Note: it is important that the text/html part is added second, because it is the
// most expressive version and (probably) the most faithful to the sender's WYSIWYG 
// editor.
var alternative = new Multipart ("alternative");
alternative.Add (plain);
alternative.Add (html);

// now create the multipart/mixed container to hold the multipart/alternative
// and the image attachment
var multipart = new Multipart ("mixed");
multipart.Add (alternative);
multipart.Add (attachment);

// now set the multipart/mixed as the message body
message.Body = multipart;
```

### Creating a Message Using a BodyBuilder (not Arnold Schwarzenegger)

If you are used to System.Net.Mail's API for creating messages, you will probably find using a BodyBuilder
much more friendly than manually creating the tree of MIME parts. Here's how you could create a message body
using a BodyBuilder:

```csharp
var message = new MimeMessage ();
message.From.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Joey", "joey@friends.com"));
message.To.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Alice", "alice@wonderland.com"));
message.Subject = "How you doin?";

var builder = new BodyBuilder ();

// Set the plain-text version of the message text
builder.TextBody = @"Hey Alice,

What are you up to this weekend? Monica is throwing one of her parties on
Saturday and I was hoping you could make it.

Will you be my +1?

-- Joey
";

// Set the html version of the message text
builder.HtmlBody = @"<p>Hey Alice,<br>
<p>What are you up to this weekend? Monica is throwing one of her parties on
Saturday and I was hoping you could make it.<br>
<p>Will you be my +1?<br>
<p>-- Joey<br>
<center><img src=""sexy-pose.jpg""></center>";

// Since sexy-pose.jpg is referenced from the html text, we'll need to add it
// to builder.LinkedResources
builder.LinkedResources.Add ("C:\\Users\\Joey\\Documents\\SexySelfies\\sexy-pose.jpg");

// We may also want to attach a calendar event for Monica's party...
builder.Attachments.Add ("C:\\Users\Joey\\Documents\\party.ics");

// Now we just need to set the message body and we're done
message.Body = builder.ToMessageBody ();
```

### Preparing to use MimeKit's S/MIME support

Before you can begin using MimeKit's S/MIME support, you will need to decide which
database to use for certificate storage.

If you are targetting any of the Xamarin platforms (or Linux), you won't need to do
anything (although you certianly can if you want to) because, by default, I've
configured MimeKit to use the Mono.Data.Sqlite binding to SQLite.

If you are, however, on any of the Windows platforms, you'll need to pick a System.Data
provider such as [System.Data.SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite).
Once you've made your choice and installed it (via NuGet or however), you'll need to
implement your own `SecureMimeContext` class. Luckily, it's very simple to do. Assuming
you've chosen System.Data.SQLite, here's how you'd implement your own `SecureMimeContext`
class:

```csharp
using System.Data.SQLite;
using MimeKit.Cryptography;

using MyAppNamespace {
    class MySecureMimeContext : DefaultSecureMimeContext
    {
        public MySecureMimeContext () : base (OpenDatabase ("C:\\wherever\\certdb.sqlite"))
        {
        }

        static IX509CertificateDatabase OpenDatabase (string fileName)
        {
            var builder = new SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder ();
            builder.DateTimeFormat = SQLiteDateFormats.Ticks;
            builder.DataSource = fileName;

            if (!File.Exists (fileName))
                SQLiteConnection.CreateFile (fileName);

            var sqlite = new SQLiteConnection (builder.ConnectionString);
            sqlite.Open ();

            return new SqliteCertificateDatabase (sqlite, "password");
        }
    }
}
```

Now that you've implemented your own SecureMimeContext, you'll want to register it with MimeKit:

```csharp
CryptographyContext.Register (typeof (MySecureMimeContext));
```

Now you are ready to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify S/MIME messages!

### Preparing to use MimeKit's PGP/MIME support

Like with S/MIME support, you also need to register your own `OpenPgpContext`. Unlike S/MIME, however,
you don't need to choose a database if you subclass `GnuPGContext` because it uses GnuPG's PGP keyrings
to load and store public and private keys. If you choose to subclass `GnuPGContext`, the only thing you
you need to do is implement a password callback method:

```csharp
using MimeKit.Cryptography;

namespace MyAppNamespace {
    class MyGnuPGContext : GnuPGContext
    {
        public MyGnuPgContext () : base ()
        {
        }
        
        protected override string GetPasswordForKey (PgpSecretKey key)
        {
            // prompt the user (or a secure password cache) for the password for the specified secret key.
            return "password";
        }
    }
}
```

Once again, to register your OpenPgpContext, you can use the following code snippet:

```csharp
CryptographyContext.Register (typeof (MyGnuPGContext));
```

Now you are ready to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify PGP/MIME messages!

### Digitally Signing Messages with S/MIME or PGP/MIME

Both S/MIME and PGP/MIME use a multipart/signed to contain the signed content and the detached signature data.

To create a multipart/signed MIME part, let's pretend we're going to digitally sign our multipart/mixed example
from the previous sample using S/MIME.

```csharp
var joey = new MailboxAddress ("Joey", "joey@friends.com");
var alice = new MailboxAddress ("Alice", "alice@wonderland.com");

var message = new MimeMessage ();
message.From.Add (joey);
message.To.Add (alice);
message.Subject = "How you doin?";

// create our message body (perhaps a multipart/mixed with the message text and some
// image attachments, for example)
var body = CreateMessageBody ();

// now to digitally sign our message body using the default S/MIME cryptography context
using (var ctx = new DefaultSecureMimeContext ()) {
    // Note: this assumes that "Joey" has an S/MIME signing certificate and private key
    // with an X.509 Subject Email identifier that matches Joey's email address.
    message.Body = MultipartSigned.Create (ctx, joey, DigestAlgorithm.Sha1, body);
}
```

For S/MIME, if you have a way for the user to configure which S/MIME certificate to use
as their signing certificate, you could also do something more like this:

```csharp
// now to digitally sign our message body using the default S/MIME cryptography context
using (var ctx = new DefaultSecureMimeContext ()) {
    var certificate = GetJoeysX509Certificate ();
    var signer = new CmsSigner (certificate);
    signer.DigestAlgorithm = DigestAlgorithm.Sha1;

    message.Body = MultipartSigned.Create (ctx, signer, body);
}
```

If you'd prefer to use PGP instead of S/MIME, things work almost exactly the same except that you
would use an OpenPGP cryptography context. For example, you might use a subclass of the
GnuPGContext that comes with MimeKit if you want to re-use the user's GnuPG keyrings (you can't
use GnuPGContext directly because it has no way of prompting the user for their passphrase).

For the sake of this example, let's pretend that you've written a minimal subclass of
MimeKit.Cryptography.GnuPGContext that simply overrides the GetPassword() method and
that this subclass is called MyGnuPGContext.

```csharp
// now to digitally sign our message body using our custom OpenPGP cryptography context
using (var ctx = new MyGnuPGContext ()) {
    // Note: this assumes that "Joey" has a PGP key that matches his email address.
    message.Body = MultipartSigned.Create (ctx, joey, DigestAlgorithm.Sha1, body);
}
```

Just like S/MIME, however, you can also do your own PGP key lookups instead of
relying on email addresses to match up with the user's private key.

```csharp
// now to digitally sign our message body using our custom OpenPGP cryptography context
using (var ctx = new MyGnuPGContext ()) {
    var key = GetJoeysPrivatePgpKey ();
    message.Body = MultipartSigned.Create (ctx, key, DigestAlgorithm.Sha1, body);
}
```

### Verifying S/MIME and PGP/MIME Digital Signatures

As mentioned earlier, both S/MIME and PGP/MIME typically use a multipart/signed part to contain the
signed content and the detached signature data.

A multipart/signed contains exactly 2 parts: the first MimeEntity is the signed content while the second
MimeEntity is the detached signature and, by default, will either be an ApplicationPgpSignature part or
an ApplicationPkcs7Signature part (depending on whether the sending client signed using OpenPGP or S/MIME).

Because the multipart/signed part may have been signed by multiple signers, it is important to
verify each of the digital signatures (one for each signer) that are returned by the
MultipartSigned.Verify() method:

```csharp
if (entity is MultipartSigned) {
    var signed = (MultipartSigned) entity;

    foreach (var signature in signed.Verify ()) {
        try {
            bool valid = signature.Verify ();

            // If valid is true, then it signifies that the signed content has not been
            // modified since this particular signer signed the content.
            //
            // However, if it is false, then it indicates that the signed content has
            // been modified.
        } catch (DigitalSignatureVerifyException) {
            // There was an error verifying the signature.
        }
    }
}
```

It should be noted, however, that while most S/MIME clients will use the preferred multipart/signed
approach, it is possible that you may encounter an "application/pkcs7-mime" part with an
"smime-type" parameter set to "signed-data". Luckily, MimeKit can handle this format as well:

```csharp
if (entity is ApplicationPkcs7Mime) {
    var pkcs7 = (ApplicationPkcs7Mime) entity;

    if (pkcs7.SecureMimeType == SecureMimeType.SignedData) {
        // extract the original content and get a list of signatures
        MimeEntity extracted;

        // Note: if you are rendering the message, you'll want to render
        // the extracted mime part rather than the application/pkcs7-mime part.
        foreach (var signature in pkcs7.Verify (out extracted)) {
            try {
                bool valid = signature.Verify ();

                // If valid is true, then it signifies that the signed content has not
                // been modified since this particular signer signed the content.
                //
                // However, if it is false, then it indicates that the signed content
                // has been modified.
            } catch (DigitalSignatureVerifyException) {
                // There was an error verifying the signature.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Contributing

The first thing you'll need to do is fork MimeKit to your own GitHub repository. Once you do that,

    git clone git@github.com/<your-account>/MimeKit.git

If you use [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio) or [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.org), all of the
solution files are configured with the coding style used by MimeKit. If you use Visual Studio or some
other editor, please try to maintain the existing coding style as best as you can.

Once you've got some changes that you'd like to submit upstream to the official MimeKit repository,
simply send me a Pull Request and I will try to review your changes in a timely manner.
