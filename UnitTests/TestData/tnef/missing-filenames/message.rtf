\uc1\pard\plain\deftab360\f0\fs20\cf0 Hi Stephen,\par
\par
Sue has encountered a Date problem while running our' New Books List'.  Can you please help us.  Apparently it is having a hernia with the ADD_DT which I would have presumed was fixed with your patches.\par
\par
Attached is the PRC file : generpts.scr\par
\par
Attached are some screen dumps which record the error message (3 MS Word .doc files)\par
\par
I am in Vancouver for the next two weeks but it is really important we get this functionality resolved ASAP.  Could you continue dialoguing with Sue and Ralph to see how we can fix this.  \par
\par
cheers, Liedeke\par
