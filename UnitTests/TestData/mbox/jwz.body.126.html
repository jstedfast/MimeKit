  <br/>The first two bodypart sent above should be part of a MIME  object.<br/>One should be type text/html, the second application/octet-stream.<br/><br/>Can anyone who cares send me back the MIME object for<br/>this message actually delivered to their UA?<br/><br/>Im finding Deming&#39; s excellent  tool to be be  very useful<br/>for signing attachements of any type, and being<br/>able to reverify the bodypart content even once the attachement<br/>is released from the mail system.<br/><br/>Peter.<br/> <br/>
