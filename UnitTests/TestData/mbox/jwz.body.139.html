We search through text/plain messages for URLs and make them clickable.<br/>Here are some examples.<br/><br/>These should all have links over them:<br/><br/>	<a href="http://home.netscape.com">http://home.netscape.com</a> and <a href="http://home.netscape.com/,">http://home.netscape.com/,</a> (and the<br/>	comma shouldn&#39;t be in the URL) &quot;<a href="http://home.netscape.com:80/&quot;">http://home.netscape.com:80/&quot;</a> <br/>	and &lt;<a href="https://home.netscape.com">https://home.netscape.com</a>&gt; and mailto:jwz as well as<br/>	mailto:jwz%2Cterry, and mailto:jwz,terry, but note that the final<br/>	commas shouldn&#39;t be in the URLs.<br/><br/>	<a href="http://host/some-random-image.map?300,200">http://host/some-random-image.map?300,200</a> should have both numbers<br/>	inside the link, and <a href="http://host/some-random.cgi?3,2,1,">http://host/some-random.cgi?3,2,1,</a> should<br/>	have all three numbers in the link, but not the trailing comma.<br/>	gopher://host/ blah blah blah.  But <a href="http://host">http://host</a>,other-junk should<br/>	stop before the comma, not include other junk in the URL.<br/>	news:some.group should work.<br/><br/>These should NOT have links over them:<br/><br/>	mailto: shouldn&#39;t, since that&#39;s useless, as is news:, nor should<br/>	about: since that&#39;s a word that occurs at the end of a sentence a <br/>	lot.  http: all by itself shouldn&#39;t have a link, neither should <br/>	gopher:, and &quot;internal-gopher-binary&quot; is a hackish internal image.<br/>	news:a shouldn&#39;t either, because it&#39;s short.<br/>	internal-external-reconnect sure shouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>Ok!  That should cover it.<br/>
